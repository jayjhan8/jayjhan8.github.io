      <p>I&rsquo;m finally back home.  It&rsquo;s been about 3 days, and boy am I glad to be back.  I&rsquo;m much better now than when I got discharged.  With all the poison fully loaded into my body, I felt like I had an out-of-body experience for most of the first day out of the hospital.  It&rsquo;s almost felt like a fever except you don&rsquo;t feel weak.  Your mind is constantly battling another conscience trying to take over and your body responds in all sorts of ways.  Yeah, chemo sucks.  No doubt about that.</p>

<p>Before I go on about how I&rsquo;m excited to be back home, let me tell you about my last few days in the hospital.  I think the fact that I was stuck in one room got to me more than anything else, because I am fairly active throughout the day.  I did my daily laps around my floor and got to stamp a foot sticker for every mile I walked.  I did close to 3 miles this time, so I&rsquo;m going to try for 6 next time &hellip; because that only makes sense.  There are two things I hate about chemo.  First is the saline solution that  &lsquo;flushes&rsquo; the PICC line (this is the iv thing I have for the time being).  Some people taste the solution, others don&rsquo;t.  Unfortunately, I do.  So everytime they change my drugs, hook up more fluids, or just about anything with the PICC line, the nurses have to flush it, and the thought of it makes me want to vomit.  Second thing I hate is the oscillating noise of the machine that controls the rate at which the drugs are pumped into me.  The clunky gadget sits right at the base of the IV stand and it sounds like a rusty mechanical clock. tick-tock-chemo-time.  Luckily, I don&rsquo;t ever have to see or hear or taste any of that once I&rsquo;m done with chemo.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m unhooked and free for couple weeks, I think I&rsquo;m back on the incline after being in the rut for almost 3 days, so I&rsquo;m really excited about that.  I&rsquo;ve been pretty amped up to watch Michigan ball, even though they didn&rsquo;t have the toughest road to get to the final, they&rsquo;re still in the final.  Villanova cats being the favorite (rightfully so, their game against Kansas was a classic exhibition), I&rsquo;m excited to see what March Madness is all about.</p>

<p>This past Sunday was Easter, and I&rsquo;m so thankful that I was not at the hospital then.  Even though I was unable to attend church due to my conditions, I felt alot of emotions that morning.  I get so thrown off by how unbelievable and incredible a human-being like me could withstand so much pain and bear so much wisdom in such a short span on time.  I naturally questioned throughout my entire life&hellip; what is the purpose of my life?  Which talent is the one that was most rewarding and life-giving?  What does a <code>good life</code> mean?  And to be honest, the questions go on because one is just an interpretation of another.  My perspective shifted when I heard the story of Jesus.  John 16:33 says, <code>In this world you will have trouble; But take heart, I have overcome the world!</code>  This man bore all of our weaknesses and pain and put them to death.  Because of Him, I can hope for an end to a cancer.  Because of Him, I can hope for an end to all evilness.  Because of Him, I can appreciate every good piece of life and look forward to lifting God up to my beloved community.  For those who know me, I don&rsquo;t really get emotional, but I felt all of that on Sunday.  Boy am I glad to be back at home.</p>
