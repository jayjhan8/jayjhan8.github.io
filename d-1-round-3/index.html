      <p>These two weeks could not have gone any quicker, but I feel like I haven&rsquo;t done all that much, not that I am supposed to be doing much anyway.  I spent most of my time reading and walking.  Rent&rsquo;s gardening and NBA Playoffs have been fun to watch.  But all of the joy is short-lived, and now I must embrace the hospital life again.  While I feel healthy once again, I don&rsquo;t feel as ready as last time.  Thinking about that hospital floor makes me nauseous.  A friend had asked if this nauseousness is comparable to being seasick or carsick.  To anticipate nausea is one thing, but to have it over a period of 10 days is a different beast.  I wouldn&rsquo;t say it is as intense, but it surely lingers for a long time.  I can&rsquo;t wait to be done with this madness.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the big day.  My doctor will go over the scan with me, and he will tell me if I need one or two more cycles. Perhaps I may need surgery or whatever it takes to get this stuff out of me.  I&rsquo;m nervous.  So anxious that I have a hard time sleeping.  What if this isn&rsquo;t it?  What if there is more?  I remain hopeful as I cling onto God&rsquo;s grace.  Do you have a wound so deep that you tried to obliterate from your memory, you wish to be freed from the associated burden?  Read this verse with me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 12 2:7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apostle Paul speaks to his vision for a church, and how thankful he is for a thorn in his body has kept him from his own arrogance.  Would you ever be grateful to have a thorn inside your body?  I wouldn&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;d cry in pain, and drown in misery.  So it&rsquo;s incredibly aspiring to have a witness like Paul who&rsquo;s focused on one thing and that&rsquo;s carrying out God&rsquo;s words.  I just finished a book called <code>Between the World and Me</code> by Ta-Nehisi Coates.  Incredibly sad and powerful, the letter to his son demonstrates the core essence of being a black person in America.  His writing conveys deep love and fear for his son in the world of Dreamers, and his success as a writer isn&rsquo;t in the writing, but to the struggle, the bedrock of his identity and those of many black people.  I don&rsquo;t mean to reduce one story to another, but Paul and Coates exemplify how each suffering shapes his story.  They didn&rsquo;t stop in the face of hardship, but they pushed forward.  Inspired by these stories, I am ready to tackle number 3.  Update to follow tomorrow.  Pray for me!</p>
