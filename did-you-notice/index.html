      <p>You may notice that the blog looks slightly different, if you haven&rsquo;t, scroll down.  <strong>You can now comment on each of my post</strong>.  I have gotten many requests to get this comment feature implemented, so I hope it works as intended.  When I was talking to Sammy earlier, I realized that the audience of my blog has grown pretty quickly.  I realize that the point of this blog is for me to tell my story to you, but I figured it&rsquo;d be nice to hear from you and be more engaging than just my words on the screen.  So if you&rsquo;re reading this post, make sure to drop a comment below.  And if you&rsquo;re up for it, include a song of your all time favorite.  I&rsquo;m just curious to know what jam you would groove to on a Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Back to the blog.  First, I apologize for the hiatus.  I wasn&rsquo;t feeling like writing a whole lot this past week.  The post-chemo feels weren&rsquo;t that much more intense, but it&rsquo;s definitely more persistent.  I still feel a tiny bit of nausea, and I think it&rsquo;s related to how chemo affects your entire GI tract.  My esophagus feels a bit tight, and my tastebuds have slightly changed.  But I&rsquo;m still eating really well.  Thanks to my mom, I get showered with nutrient-filled, scrumptious Korean food.  I also crave to be outside as much as I can.  Although I don&rsquo;t have all that much energy to run, I take alot of walks outside.  I actually haven&rsquo;t explored my neighborhood as much until recently.  And everything in my neighborhood is a treat to an eye &ndash; the horticulture, modern and old homes, and the parks.  I didn&rsquo;t know there were such nice parks in the area!  And since the first day of chemo, I&rsquo;ve seen the colors change from gray to green, and that&rsquo;s always exciting to see.</p>

<p>Couple days ago, I found out that I no longer have to shave.  Perks of chemo, they say.  I had a bit of hair left on my head, so my dad had gotten the razor and went to polish my head.  Now, I&rsquo;m a true baldie.  The whole bald thing is interesting, because it&rsquo;s the only external quality that marks my cancer.  I certainly am not used to waking up to a shiny ball of nothingness, but I&rsquo;m sure no one embraces it at first.  It&rsquo;s a new label, a new identity &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure no one wants to be associated to cancer, but I will always be a cancer patient from now on, in remission or not.  I imagine it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll look back and tell myself <code>what a crazy experience</code>.  It sort of sucks now and I will probably remember this for a long time, but when I look back at this moment years later, I will be able to say that I defeated cancer.  And c&rsquo;mon, that&rsquo;s pretty badass.</p>
