    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Welcome everyone.  Thanks for stopping by my blog.  This is very new to me, so I&rsquo;m not quite sure what to write now.  I decided to try something new given the recent turn of events in my life.   As many of you know, I was recently diagnosed with stage 3 testicular cancer.  Before you get so wrapped up about the word &ldquo;cancer,&rdquo; let me tell you how it all happened.</p>

<p>Mid-December of 2017, I found out that I had a tiny lump underneath my right nipple.  I dismissed the lump for a good few weeks just as I have done with any other temporary skin bumps or scars.  Interestingly, I had someone tell me few years back that I may get breasts from consuming foods with high estrogen content such as grapefruits and tofu.  I found the comment ridiculous then, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking it could be a possibility given my liking for tofu. I <strong>love</strong> tofu.  Few weeks passed, and the lump did not reduce in size, so I figured going to see a doctor wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.  The internist deemed the lump as gynecomastia.  It occurs to many teenagers going through puberty and aging men.  I didn&rsquo;t think too much about it as long as it wasn&rsquo;t life-threatening, and I don&rsquo;t really mind another cycle of puberty, either &ndash; A few more inches could help me acheive my OG childhood dream in becoming the next basketball star.  The internist had recommended that I get an ultrasound on my testicles as it may be excreting more estrogen in my body than usual.  Again without thinking too much, I went ahead and did just that.</p>

<p>The next day is when I hear about <em>Testicular Cancer</em> for the very first time.   Everything happened pretty quickly afterwards &ndash; I met with the  urologist, scheduled a surgery to remove the cancerous testicle, and told my parents.  As I wait for the pathology results, I did some research on testicular cancer.  Some promising words &ndash; &ldquo;If any cancer, this is the one you want.&rdquo;   It has some abnormally high cure rates in the 90%, and most often times it&rsquo;s either in stage 1 or 2.  At this point, I&rsquo;m thinking to myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exhibiting any of the later stage symptoms, I&rsquo;m going to be alright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew something was off the moment I saw the nurse at the urology clinic.  Heaviness in her greeting tone and a sullen expression on her face.  I go in and my urologist says I am in stage 3 and I need to go see an oncologist for treatment.  This is when I thought, &ldquo;Dang, I&rsquo;m in for a long journey.&rdquo;  My parents flew in shortly afterwards and now I&rsquo;m preparing for a chemotherapy treatment starting this Sunday.  Over the course of the next 3 or 4 months, I&rsquo;ll be sharing my day-to-day journey in chemo.  This is a way for me to communicate to others on how I am doing, but I also share in hopes to encourage you in your own battle.  Whatever that may be, I hope God is guiding and strengthening you along that journey as He will be in mine.</p>
