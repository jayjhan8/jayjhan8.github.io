<p>This blog was partly for me so that I can write and process my own thoughts.  But this blog was primarily written for you.  For my friends, family, and anyone who cares enough to take the time out of their day to read this thing.  It&rsquo;s been about 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> weeks since the first day of treatment, and I still wonder if this is all just a bad dream.  A checkup, surgery, and prognosis.  It all happened pretty quickly.  And I was only able to grieve, mourn, and face this entire situation because of the people I chose to surround myself with.  And I&rsquo;m so blessed by and grateful for your prayers, thoughts, and messages.  Really, I don&rsquo;t think I would&rsquo;ve made it without you guys.</p>

<p>When I think about a group of people I really connected with, I think about my Acapella group back in college.  We called ourselves 58 Greene.  And I really love my greenies.  They have shaped me into who I am today and have given me an experience that I wouldn&rsquo;t trade anything else for.  Our 25th Anniversay is this weekend, and it was one of the three things I really wanted to be a part of this year.  I wanted to be there to celebrate with the current greenies, updating each other on how boring life has been compared to our college days, and jam throughout the entire night until our bodies could not.   And all of this made me think about my friends.  Dear friends who are reading this blog, the text you send every morning to check up on me, or an instagram messsage you&rsquo;ve left me, or a gift that you have sent to encourage me, or phone calls to keep me upbeat &ndash; all of those things mean <em>so</em> much to me.  They get me through the toughest days, and it allows me to reflect on those relationships I have with you all.  So thank you again.  Thank you for sticking by my side, and thank you for encouraging me.  Cheers to the day that we can meet and celebrate again!</p>
