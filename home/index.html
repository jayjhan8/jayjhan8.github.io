      <p>I&rsquo;m home!!  Sorry it&rsquo;s taken a bit since I&rsquo;ve last posted.  I am much better now, but I struggled alot this time around.  I felt like a tired runner crawling to the finish line.  I couldn&rsquo;t really eat much at all.   I usually weigh around 130 lbs, and I was probably closer to 135lbs before I started chemo, but this recent cycle set me back to about 115lbs.  Thankfully, I&rsquo;m back to 125lbs today, but I just couldn&rsquo;t keep any food down my throat this time.   Luckily, I didn&rsquo;t vomit, and I made it a personal goal not to do so even though there were couple times I came pretty close to it.  Albeit my tastebuds going bitter, I am now eating much better and actually finishing meals.  I am going to focus on rebuilding myself over these next weeks &ndash; eating healthier and exercising regularly. The next scan is scheduled to take place on June 25th, and my doc will go over the results with me the week afterwards.  Let&rsquo;s continually hope for good news!</p>
