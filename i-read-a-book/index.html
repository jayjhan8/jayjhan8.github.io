      <p>I have one week left until I go back for my 2nd round of chemo.  While I&rsquo;m dreading the time I get to be stuck on the same floor of the hospital for 5 days in a row, I&rsquo;m also enjoying every moment that I am not there.  Spending time with my parents, conversing with friends, and even working from home.  Speaking of work, I want to give a shoutout to my co-workers and the executive staff for supporting me in my fight against cancer.  The day I got diagnosed with cancer, one of the first things I had to think about was my work situation.  I received an overwhelming support from not only my teammates and my director, but even from the founders of the company.  Work could have easily been a burden, but Qualtrics have made a safe environment for me to enjoy work as I&rsquo;m being treated.  This is one of the many things I&rsquo;m grateful for.</p>

<p>A quick update on my body.  I had lost about 5 pounds up until the day I was discharged from the hospital, but I&rsquo;ve regained most of it back.  Mom&rsquo;s been packing in the protein for me after a much debated talk on whether meat is bad for you.  When I was first diagnosed with cancer, my immediate reaction was to search for anything I could do to remediate cancer, and all the blogs I found unanimously pointed towards a healthy, plant-based diet.  I tried being a vegan for few days but I couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose weight while getting chemo, so I&rsquo;ve reverted back to my original diet with a heavy emphasis on veggies.  Luckily, my tastebuds haven&rsquo;t been affected so I&rsquo;ve been able to eat and enjoy my meals.  My white blood cell counts have significantly dropped, so I&rsquo;ve been at home to minimize any contact with an infection.  Lastly, I have begun to lose hair.  I&rsquo;ve always wanted to become bald at some point, so I&rsquo;m actually excited for my new look.  Who knows?  Maybe I&rsquo;ll look sexier and will keep it for the rest of my life.  Aside from those few things, I feel pretty good!</p>

<p>I just finished a book called &ldquo;When Breath Becomes Air&rdquo; by Paul Kalanithi.  I first heard about it few weeks ago from a friend, and I had wanted to read it immediately afterwards.  The book speaks to Paul&rsquo;s journey as an aspiring neurosurgeon and a stage 4 lung cancer patient.  Heartbreaking but undistracted, Paul&rsquo;s story is not only a beautiful depiction of the joys and sufferings that a cancer patient goes through, but also a testament to his strength as he dives into unanswered questions on mortality.  I think this is a must read if you want to understand what a cancer patient goes through.  I went through everything he did &ndash; cryopreservation of semen, chemo, ct scans, and the anxiety that ensues from more scans.  Paul died at the age of 34 &ndash; most would say it&rsquo;s an early age to see death.  But when exactly is it the right time?  Contrary to Paul, mortality was something I never had the desire to explore.  It&rsquo;s associated with pain and grief.  Although Paul did not answer all the questions he had, he faced death gracefully.  His book enlightened me on a different perspective of death.  Not one covered in tears or sadness, but one that&rsquo;s beautiful and brave.  He is no longer in the operating room performing surgeries, but his words will continue to help and encourage the lives of many people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be ready. Be seated. See what courage sounds like. See how brave it is to reveal yourself in this way. But above all, see what it is to still live, to profoundly influence the lives of others after you are gone, by your words.” ― Paul Kalanithi, When Breath Becomes Air</p>
