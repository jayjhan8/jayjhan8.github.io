[{"categories":null,"contents":"We are a God-fearing, determined couple currently surviving a pandemic and long distance together. We\u0026rsquo;ve been practically together for 5 years and are very eager to get married. Jay made this website for Sammy, to commemorate her first quarter century of life. She\u0026rsquo;s remarkably beautiful and talented, and I\u0026rsquo;m so blessed to call her my girlfriend.
