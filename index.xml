      <description>Yesterday, we celebrated the fallen soldiers who died in the honor of protecting our country. Although I did not grow up in a military family, I grew up in a military base and I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed many individuals who serve this country with passion and their lives. But it&amp;rsquo;s only after this illness that I am understanding the gravity and the significance of the sacrifice put forth by these soldiers. Life is way too fragile, yet many people fail to recognize that (including me).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s been 8 weeks since I&amp;rsquo;ve first started treatment. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit skinnier and balder, but not weaker. My friend was saying that it truly felt long, but 8 weeks isn&amp;rsquo;t all that long. I was in the hospital for only 15 days total. But yes, those days in the hosptial felt like forever. I remember the last day of this past cycle, I was so eager to leave the hospital.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m home!! Sorry it&amp;rsquo;s taken a bit since I&amp;rsquo;ve last posted. I am much better now, but I struggled alot this time around. I felt like a tired runner crawling to the finish line. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really eat much at all. I usually weigh around 130 lbs, and I was probably closer to 135lbs before I started chemo, but this recent cycle set me back to about 115lbs. Thankfully, I&amp;rsquo;m back to 125lbs today, but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep any food down my throat this time.</description>

      <description>Good news. All around. My doc came in and started with &amp;ldquo;Let me tell you the good news first&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; but he said that was it. Only good news. Really good news.
The questionable matter in liver is not cancer. It&amp;rsquo;s still the same size as it was before, which means that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t respond to chemo and therefore is benign. The tumors in my lung have shrunk significantly. I had two big ones approximately about 1.</description>

      <title>D-1, Round 3</title>

      <description>These two weeks could not have gone any quicker, but I feel like I haven&amp;rsquo;t done all that much, not that I am supposed to be doing much anyway. I spent most of my time reading and walking. Rent&amp;rsquo;s gardening and NBA Playoffs have been fun to watch. But all of the joy is short-lived, and now I must embrace the hospital life again. While I feel healthy once again, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel as ready as last time.</description>

      <description>Seattle is one of the most beautiful places to live in. It took me a while to get used to the winter drag, but I&amp;rsquo;ve adapted and learned to appreciate the summer. The sun&amp;rsquo;s out today, birds are chirping, and the bees are zapping away &amp;ndash; summer&amp;rsquo;s just around the corner. On my rooftop, I can look far out into the horizon to the South, where there are so many trees and other plants interspersed around buildings.</description>

      <description>I realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak about couple big events coming up. I have finished 2 rounds of chemo and I&amp;rsquo;m currently on my last off week before I head back into the hospital. This coming Thursday, I have my 2nd CT scan. This is the first since I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten chemo, so we&amp;rsquo;ll have a good comparison of before and after chemo. Although I won&amp;rsquo;t know much about it that day, I continually ask for your thoughts and prayers that the cancer is full eradicated.</description>

      <description>You may notice that the blog looks slightly different, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, scroll down. You can now comment on each of my post. I have gotten many requests to get this comment feature implemented, so I hope it works as intended. When I was talking to Sammy earlier, I realized that the audience of my blog has grown pretty quickly. I realize that the point of this blog is for me to tell my story to you, but I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to hear from you and be more engaging than just my words on the screen.</description>

      <description>Nausea is much worse this time around. I even asked for some additional anti-nausea meds because I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about it. Aside from the nausea, everything else is what I have expected so far &amp;ndash; fatigue, loss of apetite, constipation, and fluid build-up near my head. I thought that this round might be easier knowing what to expect, but it&amp;rsquo;s.. still difficult. I&amp;rsquo;m currently on my 3rd day of chemo this week, and I&amp;rsquo;m dreading the last few days.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for the next round of chemo. I am loving my new almost-bald look, and I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty normal aside from a few cold symptoms. Alot has happened these past 3 weeks. I have felt the worst of chemo within the first week, and then I felt better and better each day. I thought I was going to go on with my normal life for a week, but I began to cough and sneeze more frequently.</description>
