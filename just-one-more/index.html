      <p>Good news.  All around.  My doc came in and started with &ldquo;Let me tell you the good news first&hellip;&rdquo; but he said that was it.  Only good news.  Really good news.</p>

<p>The questionable matter in liver is not cancer.  It&rsquo;s still the same size as it was before, which means that it doesn&rsquo;t respond to chemo and therefore is benign.  The tumors in my lung have shrunk significantly.  I had two big ones approximately about 1.5cm each, one is now at 5mm, and the other at 8mm.  Doc had mentioned potential surgery, but now he even thinks that&rsquo;s unnecessary.  So it&rsquo;s this cycle of chemo, and I have one more CT scan to verify that both lesions have reduced beyond the need of surgery.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going on my first bag of chemo in a few minutes, and I feel the impending nausea.  But who cares, THIS IS MY LAST ONE!</p>
