    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Yesterday, we celebrated the fallen soldiers who died in the honor of protecting our country.  Although I did not grow up in a military family, I grew up in a military base and I&rsquo;ve witnessed many individuals who serve this country with passion and their lives.  But it&rsquo;s only after this illness that I am understanding the gravity and the significance of the sacrifice put forth by these soldiers.   Life is way too fragile, yet many people fail to recognize that (including me).  But these soldiers are trained and geared to put protecting this country above everything else.  Their families, loved ones, and aspirations.  I can&rsquo;t help but admire the courage and strength that the soldiers demonstrate &ndash; not so much the physical part, but the mental battle in risking their lives.</p>

<p>I should&rsquo;ve been in the hospital, but by God&rsquo;s grace I&rsquo;m home.  As said in the previous post, the questionable matter in my liver turned out to be benign, and the tumors in my lungs have responded very well to chemo.  I&rsquo;m currently recovering from my last cycle of chemo, and I&rsquo;m feeling better everyday.  I have a slight cold with some phlegm, but nothing too concerning.  I&rsquo;ve begun to do some work remotely as well.  I thought I&rsquo;d never say this, but it&rsquo;s nice to be back in meetings as my body&rsquo;s been itching to be productive.  I can&rsquo;t wait to be back to 100%.</p>
