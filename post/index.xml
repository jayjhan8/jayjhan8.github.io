      <description>Good news. All around. My doc came in and started with &amp;ldquo;Let me tell you the good news first&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; but he said that was it. Only good news. Really good news.
The questionable matter in liver is not cancer. It&amp;rsquo;s still the same size as it was before, which means that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t respond to chemo and therefore is benign. The tumors in my lung have shrunk significantly. I had two big ones approximately about 1.</description>

      <title>D-1, Round 3</title>

      <description>These two weeks could not have gone any quicker, but I feel like I haven&amp;rsquo;t done all that much, not that I am supposed to be doing much anyway. I spent most of my time reading and walking. Rent&amp;rsquo;s gardening and NBA Playoffs have been fun to watch. But all of the joy is short-lived, and now I must embrace the hospital life again. While I feel healthy once again, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel as ready as last time.</description>

      <description>Seattle is one of the most beautiful places to live in. It took me a while to get used to the winter drag, but I&amp;rsquo;ve adapted and learned to appreciate the summer. The sun&amp;rsquo;s out today, birds are chirping, and the bees are zapping away &amp;ndash; summer&amp;rsquo;s just around the corner. On my rooftop, I can look far out into the horizon to the South, where there are so many trees and other plants interspersed around buildings.</description>

      <description>I realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak about couple big events coming up. I have finished 2 rounds of chemo and I&amp;rsquo;m currently on my last off week before I head back into the hospital. This coming Thursday, I have my 2nd CT scan. This is the first since I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten chemo, so we&amp;rsquo;ll have a good comparison of before and after chemo. Although I won&amp;rsquo;t know much about it that day, I continually ask for your thoughts and prayers that the cancer is full eradicated.</description>

      <description>You may notice that the blog looks slightly different, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, scroll down. You can now comment on each of my post. I have gotten many requests to get this comment feature implemented, so I hope it works as intended. When I was talking to Sammy earlier, I realized that the audience of my blog has grown pretty quickly. I realize that the point of this blog is for me to tell my story to you, but I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to hear from you and be more engaging than just my words on the screen.</description>

      <description>Nausea is much worse this time around. I even asked for some additional anti-nausea meds because I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about it. Aside from the nausea, everything else is what I have expected so far &amp;ndash; fatigue, loss of apetite, constipation, and fluid build-up near my head. I thought that this round might be easier knowing what to expect, but it&amp;rsquo;s.. still difficult. I&amp;rsquo;m currently on my 3rd day of chemo this week, and I&amp;rsquo;m dreading the last few days.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for the next round of chemo. I am loving my new almost-bald look, and I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty normal aside from a few cold symptoms. Alot has happened these past 3 weeks. I have felt the worst of chemo within the first week, and then I felt better and better each day. I thought I was going to go on with my normal life for a week, but I began to cough and sneeze more frequently.</description>

 This blog was partly for me so that I can write and process my own thoughts. But this blog was primarily written for you. For my friends, family, and anyone who cares enough to take the time out of their day to read this thing. It&amp;rsquo;s been about 2 1&amp;frasl;2 weeks since the first day of treatment, and I still wonder if this is all just a bad dream.</description>

      <description>I have one week left until I go back for my 2nd round of chemo. While I&amp;rsquo;m dreading the time I get to be stuck on the same floor of the hospital for 5 days in a row, I&amp;rsquo;m also enjoying every moment that I am not there. Spending time with my parents, conversing with friends, and even working from home. Speaking of work, I want to give a shoutout to my co-workers and the executive staff for supporting me in my fight against cancer.</description>

      <title>Back Home</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally back home. It&amp;rsquo;s been about 3 days, and boy am I glad to be back. I&amp;rsquo;m much better now than when I got discharged. With all the poison fully loaded into my body, I felt like I had an out-of-body experience for most of the first day out of the hospital. It&amp;rsquo;s almost felt like a fever except you don&amp;rsquo;t feel weak. Your mind is constantly battling another conscience trying to take over and your body responds in all sorts of ways.</description>
