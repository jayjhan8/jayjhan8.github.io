      <p>I realized that I didn&rsquo;t speak about couple big events coming up.  I have finished 2 rounds of chemo and I&rsquo;m currently on my last off week before I head back into the hospital.  This coming Thursday, I have my 2nd CT scan.  This is the first since I&rsquo;ve gotten chemo, so we&rsquo;ll have a good comparison of before and after chemo.  Although I won&rsquo;t know much about it that day, I continually ask for your thoughts and prayers that the cancer is full eradicated.  I&rsquo;m nervous, but I hope for great results.  I go see my oncologist the Monday I get admitted for my 3rd cycle.  This is the meeting I find out about a lot of things.  Cancer in my liver, how much the tumors in the lungs have shrunk, etc.  It&rsquo;s been tough, but I&rsquo;ve been preparing myself for 4 cycles of chemo.  It could be more, or less.  But I&rsquo;m thinking about one project at a time, and I can only hope and pray that the doctor has only good things to say.  We&rsquo;ve had an amazing week of sun here in Seattle with a quick rain break this weekend.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to these brighters days!</p>
