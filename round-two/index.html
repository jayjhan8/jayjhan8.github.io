      <p>It&rsquo;s time for the next round of chemo.  I am loving my new almost-bald look, and I&rsquo;m feeling pretty normal aside from a few cold symptoms.  Alot has happened these past 3 weeks. I have felt the worst of chemo within the first week, and then I felt better and better each day.  I thought I was going to go on with my normal life for a week, but I began to cough and sneeze more frequently.  I stayed at home for most of this past week to reduce the chances of getting infected. I also found out that my skin is allergic to chlorohexidine,  the antiseptic that is put on top of incision point of my PICC line.  Nurses were taken back by how red and bumpy my skin reacted to the substance.  It&rsquo;s still pretty itchy, so I think I may have to go with a solution that doesn&rsquo;t involve the chlorohexidine.  Only downside is that I have to get that renewed everyday vs. every week.   Should be easy enough while I&rsquo;m in the hospital.</p>

<p>Many friends came to visit, and I&rsquo;ve let more people know about my situation.  We&rsquo;ve shared conversations, I recorded couple videos, and read a ton.  I feel like I&rsquo;m ready, but to be brutally honest, I&rsquo;m scared.  I feel more fragile and I&rsquo;m not the healthiest (although, that&rsquo;s the point of chemo).  I don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in the same room for 5 days in a row.  I don&rsquo;t want to sleep to the haunting tick-tocks.  I don&rsquo;t want to be flushed with the saline solutions.  But I fight because I know that I am not in this alone.  And we keep fighting until there is no more to be fought.  A project, after another.</p>
