      <p>It&rsquo;s been a while. I&rsquo;m not sure if anyone is actually looking at the blog, but here&rsquo;s a quick update anyway.  I&rsquo;m feeling day by day.  I caught a cold maybe about 2 weeks since the last day of treatment, and my body is extremely slow in recovering from it.  I haven&rsquo;t had a fever, so the cold itself has been managable.  My scan, hopefully the one that the doctor can look and deem my cancer is indeed gone, is about couple weeks out.  I was at peace with it for a while, or maybe I was just focusing on getting better from chemo.  Now, I&rsquo;m having all sorts of thoughts about this scan.  What if this isn&rsquo;t it?  What if the cancer came back more aggressively?  What if my life forward isn&rsquo;t what I had dreamed and imagined it to be?  I had these thoughts right before I started chemo about 3 months ago.  Then, I started feeling pain in my lower abdomen and my head.  These are signs of a mestasisized testicular cancer, so I had immediately requested for a brain MRI.  Fortunately, there was nothing there.  In hindsight, I was probably thinking so much that the anxiety took a toll on my body.  I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;s the same case this time around &ndash; intermittent chest pain that I can&rsquo;t help but think that it&rsquo;s cancer progressing in my lungs.  2 weeks!</p>

<p>My sister and dad are both gone now.  Many of you may not know how I felt about my family coming to stay with me.  Of course, I would fly across the country to take care of my son if he was in serious danger.  And that&rsquo;s what exactly what my parents did &ndash; they flew in immediately after finding out my prognosis, and it&rsquo;s been 3 months since they have been with me.  There wasn&rsquo;t much time to think about the whole situation.  I was going to get chemo and my parents were going to come and help during this time.  But my house was already tight on space for 3 people, and adding 3 more people was going to be tough not only on my roommates but also for everyone else.  Plus, I am a fairly independent person who seeks out for alone time.  As you can see, I was pretty skeptical about their stay.  But as time went on, they adjusted to living with me and me with them.  I realized that this was one of those blessings in disguise, because I don&rsquo;t think I was ever going to have that much time with my family ever again.  Me, my sister, mom and dad in one living room.  And when my dad left us in tears, I was overcome with emotions.  Emotions that solidified my love for them and my desire to be with them more often.  Emotions from gratitude and the joy of suffering together as a family.  Emotions that the rock of the family was now leaving us to resume his normal life back in Korea.  You&rsquo;ve asked how I was able to stay so positive during this fight.  The answer is my family.  My parents have taught me how to smile during my lowest moments, and I am grateful to be a loving brother to my one and only sister.  &lsquo;Till next time pops and Jen!</p>
