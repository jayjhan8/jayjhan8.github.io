      <p>Seattle is one of the most beautiful places to live in.  It took me a while to get used to the winter drag, but I&rsquo;ve adapted and learned to appreciate the summer.  The sun&rsquo;s out today, birds are chirping, and the bees are zapping away &ndash; summer&rsquo;s just around the corner.  On my rooftop, I can look far out into the horizon to the South, where there are so many trees and other plants interspersed around buildings. What a blessing to be a part of this PNW summer!  I went for a run today for the first time in a long while.  I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m completely out of shape or it&rsquo;s that the chemo has taken a toll on me, but my lungs couldn&rsquo;t keep up after an easy jog.  That&rsquo;s okay, I have to start building myself up slowly, and I&rsquo;ll be ready for a marathon soon enough.  Maybe.  We&rsquo;ll see.  Regardless, I enjoy running because I think clearly and freely.  It&rsquo;s one way I destress and find peace.  Thanks to you all who have been commenting on the blog!  Your words are encouraging to me, and I find joy and courage in the encouragements.  D-1 until the scan!</p>
