      <p>Tomorrow is the day! I will get admitted around 11AM and I imagine the nurses will work their magic in hooking me up to all the drugs that I need ;).  The names of these drugs form my chemotherapy regimen called VIP.  I knew I was special, just thought I&rsquo;d never hear it from  a doctor.  Nurses have informed me of my potential side effects and what to expect for my treatment.  You know, hair loss, low blood cell count, and whatever.   Simply put, I&rsquo;ll be receiving the drugs periodically over the next 5 days while I&rsquo;m in the hospital &ndash; I will be on my merry way to beating cancer.</p>

<p>These past few days, I&rsquo;ve been reaching out to close friends for prayer and encouragement.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever asked so many people for prayers so openly, but it&rsquo;s one way I truly feel connected to all the people that surround and encourage me.  And right now,  I feel more loved and supported than ever before.  Going back to the whole VIP shebang, I have come to accept that this is just one of many challenges I&rsquo;ll face, and eventually overcome.  At first, I was frightened by the words <code>cancer</code> and <code>chemotherapy.</code>  It almost felt like a bad dream, as if I was one of the few chosen ones for the Hunger Games.  But it ironically turns out that I&rsquo;ve already witnessed so many blessings ever since the diagnosis.  I got to reconnect with family and old friends, and felt God stirring in me and those around me.  After all, this is a cancer that is curable! Many people don&rsquo;t get to hear that.  Whether it&rsquo;s 50% or 90%, I&rsquo;ve got a shot at this whole thing!  I don&rsquo;t know about how you feel, but I really do feel <strong>blessed</strong>.  Even the name of my treatment says so.  I felt especially encouraged after one phone call with a stranger whom I now consider a friend.  He had undergone chemotherapy and I was only calling to hear his side of the story, but this man had shared with me so much wisdom and positivity like I&rsquo;ve never felt before.  This was just over the phone, too!  The most notable part about our conversation was his analogy on chemo to projects.  Some projects present a harms way and others don&rsquo;t, but we all have some projects to complete.  So this chemotherapy is just another project.  A project that may be difficult, a project that may invoke more projects.  Regardless, it&rsquo;s a project that I will complete until I have no more projects.  And with that, I&rsquo;m going to celebrate a start of a new project tomorrow.  One that will be extremely rewarding.  Good night!</p>
