<h1 id="day-1">Day 1</h1>

<p>I got admitted around 11AM, but the actual chemo didn&rsquo;t start until 7PM.  I drew more blood, added a PICC line (a glorified IV), and got a MRI done on my brain just to make sure there is no cancer there.  Today is my first day after the 6 full hours of chemo that started around 7PM yesterday and ended around 2AM the following day.  I couldn&rsquo;t really do much because I was so anxious in anticipating what the chemo will do to my body on the first day.  Fortunately, I&rsquo;m not feeling any different than how I did yesterday. Maybe a bit of ligthheadedness, but none really.   It&rsquo;s incredibly hard to explain the sensation of my body undergoing chemo.  I think the best way I can describe it is that my mind is really confused.  I&rsquo;m given steroids and anti-nausea meds for a good 30-45m before I get the chemo drugs.  Then once these chemo drugs kick in, I slowly get tired as if my body and the meds are constantly fighting each other.  It&rsquo;s just an uneasy feeling.  But boy, am I glad that I still don&rsquo;t have nausea.  Did I mention that the hospital I&rsquo;m staying at has a full on meal service?  I had a Pacific Northwest Salmon last night, and I enjoyed myself a lovely linguine with heirloom tomatoes with some focaccia bread spread with basil, pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes for lunch.  Mhhm.</p>

<h1 id="day-2-3">Day 2, 3</h1>

<p>I felt noticably tired.  My appetite is waning and nausea is creeping on me.  Day 2 is when I realized I <em>truly</em> have a long battle ahead.  But hey, what&rsquo;s worth a fight if it&rsquo;s not going to challenge me?  Bring it CANCER.  In the shower, I thought back to the first half marathon I ran when I was back in school.  I was super amped up for it because unlike other races, I got to cross the border to Canada from Detroit and back.  Training for it was difficult, but it was nothing like the actual race.  I remember having to use the restroom halfway into the race, and my legs were numb probably about 7 miles in.  But I didn&rsquo;t stop running, because I was determined to finish the race without walking.  I may have slowed down, but I finished the race with all that I had with the roaring crowd cheering at the finish line.  After the shower, I was determined to finish this battle, too.  Vomiting or headaches or whatever, I&rsquo;m going to finish <em>strong</em>.</p>

<p>And chemo isn&rsquo;t really all that bad if you have amazing people stopping by and cheering you on.  I got a handwritten letter from my church and I have been reading that almost everyday.  I feel so blessed to have such an army of intercessors pouring out for me.  The universal response to my diagnosis from my friends and family is &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be praying for you.&rdquo;  Believers or not, prayer is what everyone resorts to.  It&rsquo;s something that unites all of us in the battle and it&rsquo;s where I draw my strength and courage from.  So keep them coming!  We&rsquo;ll tackle this together :).  Onto Day 4!!</p>
