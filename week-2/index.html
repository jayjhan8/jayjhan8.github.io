      <p>Nausea is much worse this time around.  I even asked for some additional anti-nausea meds because I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.  Aside from the nausea, everything else is what I have expected so far &ndash; fatigue, loss of apetite, constipation, and fluid build-up near my head.  I thought that this round might be easier knowing what to expect, but it&rsquo;s.. still difficult.  I&rsquo;m currently on my 3rd day of chemo this week, and I&rsquo;m dreading the last few days.  But as always, there&rsquo;s good news.</p>

<p>AFP and Beta-HCG are hormones that are measured to determine the severity of the cancer.  They are known as tumor markers, and these values were way above the standard average before my surgery.  After the surgery, these tumor markers dropped a little bit, and after 1 one cycle of chemo, they are now in the <code>normal</code> range.  The only conclusion doctors can draw from this is that chemo is working.  I think that it&rsquo;s a pretty good turnout for one scoop of chemo.  My oncologist once again reassured me that he thinks it&rsquo;ll be over in 3 cycles.  I am honestly preparing myself for 4 cycles, but if it is 3, we are going to celebrate people.  You are all invited, and we are going to celebrate on my rooftop. But let&rsquo;s hold that excitement until my next scan.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also done a fair amount of walking.  In 2 days, I&rsquo;ve walked 4 miles so I&rsquo;m hoping to have 8 done by the end of this week.  Apparently, 13 miles will earn me a certificate, so I might go for that next cycle of chemo.  This floor is tiny, but I have witnessed a variety of activities that have taken place.  In the morning, there are ton of doctors floating around each room, and as they talk about the patient and his/her symptoms, I can feel a sense of tightness and seriousness in the clones of white coats everytime I pass by them.  I see visitors grieving for their daughter with a newfound cancer, and I see patients laughing and enjoying a simple board game.  I see more doctors and eavesdrop on cases of cancer that have not been easily cured by chemo.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an endless possibility of drugs we can give him..&rdquo; she says.  My nurse had told me that she went through 8 cycles of chemo.  She had just moved to Tennessee to play volleyball with University of Tennessee and then she was diagnosed with cancer.  That experience paved her career path as a nurse, and now she&rsquo;s a registered nurse on the same floor she was treated when she was 19 years old.  The story is incredibly inspiring, and I, too, hope that I can use my story to shape the lives of others.</p>
