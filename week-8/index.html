    <div class="article-content">
      <p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s been 8 weeks since I&rsquo;ve first started treatment.  I&rsquo;m a bit skinnier and balder, but not weaker.  My friend was saying that it truly felt long, but 8 weeks isn&rsquo;t all that long.  I was in the hospital for only 15 days total. But yes, those days in the hosptial felt like forever.  I remember the last day of this past cycle, I was so eager to leave the hospital.  Just particularly that day, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep knowing that there is poison seeping into my body.  I remember the sweat, and waking up every hour to use the bathroom as my body naturally tries to cleanse itself from the poison.  I don&rsquo;t ever wish anyone to go through chemo.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m thankful for it all.  I&rsquo;m thankful that there was no cancer in my liver.  I&rsquo;m thankful for all the doctors and nurses who are actively working to find a better cure for cancer and providing patients with the best care possible.  I&rsquo;m thankful for everyone who has prayed for my completely healing.  I&rsquo;m thankful for this experience in that now I can relate to cancer patients worldwide.  Mortality isn&rsquo;t something people regularly think about unless they are forced to do so.  One thing I&rsquo;ve learned from potentially facing mortality is that my life is not my own.  I went from being the healthiest in the family to having cancer all in matters of months.  Never take anything for granted, as every life on this planet is constructed precariously and precisely.  I mourn for those undergoing pain and suffering through treatment, and I also feel for the people who have lost innocent ones to unfortunate tragedies.</p>

<p>Today, I lift my prayers up to the victims and their families of the Santa Fe High School shooting.  No student or teacher should ever need to worry about a mass shooting, and it&rsquo;s ridiculous that America has yet to come up with an action to tackle gun control in schools.</p>
